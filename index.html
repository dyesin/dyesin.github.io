      <p>Utilities to make Practice-Web EMR even better</p>

<p>Practice-Web is popular dental office practice management software (EMR). This software has been developed on open-source "Open Dental" platform.</p>

<p>Since mySQL database is used to power this EMR, It has been very easy to connect and build missing reports as well as to build data visualization.</p>

<p>This project is not meant to replace core functionality of Practice-Web but rather enhance it with reports and charts useful in analyzing patient and financial data.</p>

<p>I plan to publish scripts and report builders which I have found useful in analyzing busy dental practice in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me with any questions. I am also available for consulting.</p>
